Personal Storage Management System

This is a "small" personal project where i'll use Java, JavaFX, the Gson-Libary and Outpan.com as Barcode libary.
I want to build an application, with which i can manage the items in my basement (preferably groceries).

Physical parts are: 
  - TaoTronics USB Laser-Barcodescanner
  - any not yet defined pc with screen
  - database (in the future)
