# StorageSystem
Personal Storage Management System

This is a "small" personal project where i'll use Java, JavaFX, the Gson-Libary and Outpan.com as Barcode libary.
I want to build an application, with which i can manage the items in my basement (preferably groceries).
I'll try to keep the setup costs as low as possible, so it'll be a system everyone can build.

Physical parts are: 
  - TaoTronics USB Laser-Barcodescanner (23€)
  - the hardware will also include an RaspberryPI 3 and an not yet defined screen (PI3 starterkit = 100€, Screen = ?)

------------------------------
Sum: 123€
