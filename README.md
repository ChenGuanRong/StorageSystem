# StorageSystem
Personal Storage Management System

This is a "small" personal project where i'll use Java, JavaFX, the Gson-Libary, Apache-Web-Server, JSON-server and Outpan.com as Barcode libary.
I want to build an application, with which i can manage the items in my basement (preferably groceries).
I'll try to keep the setup costs as low as possible, so it'll be a system everyone can build.
I have to admit, that it got more expensive than i thought. (You could decrease the price by just buying a Pi (35€) and a smaller screen (30-45€) to about 100€).

Physical parts are: 
  - TaoTronics USB Laser-Barcodescanner (23€)
  - RaspberryPI 3 StarterKit which includes: (100€)
      - Raspberry Pi 3
      - Your Choice of Pibow 3
      - 8GB NOOBs microSD card
      - Chiclet Keyboard
      - Optical Mouse
      - Official Raspberry Pi 2A PSUn>
      - HDMI cable
      - Raspberry Pi Stickers
  - Tontec 7 inch High Resolution 1024 * 600 Screen Display LCD TFT Monitor(55€)

------------------------------
Total costs: 178€
